/*If we want to do the sort in-place, we can use quicksort, a standard textbook algorithm.

Algorithm

We'll maintain two pointers i and j. The loop invariant is everything below i has parity 0 (ie. A[k] % 2 == 0 when k < i), and everything above j has parity 1.

Then, there are 4 cases for (A[i] % 2, A[j] % 2):

If it is (0, 1), then everything is correct: i++ and j--.

If it is (1, 0), we swap them so they are correct, then continue.

If it is (0, 0), only the i place is correct, so we i++ and continue.

If it is (1, 1), only the j place is correct, so we j-- and continue.

Throughout all 4 cases, the loop invariant is maintained, and j-i is getting smaller. So eventually we will be done with the array sorted as desired.*/
