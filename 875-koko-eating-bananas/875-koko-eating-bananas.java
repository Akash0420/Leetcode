/*Let's understand the solution, as we are going to be using Binary Search we have given an Array [3,6,7,11] 
And we have to eat every single pile of bananas in less than or equals to hours = 8.
If we not able to do that Gurad will kill KOKO [just a joke] 
As we know that the potential rate that we're eating bananas at k is going to be between 1 that's the minimum it could possibly be. The max it could possibly be is going to be whatever the max in our input array is and that is 11.
So, then we're going to initialize a range like this k = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] the entire range we have. Going all the way from 1 to the max value 11.

So, in other words we're going to have a left pointer at the minimum and a right pointer at the maximum . Then we compute the middle by taking the average of left & right / 2 i.e. 1 + 11 / 2 = 6. So, our middle will be here at 6 in other words that k we're trying is going to be here at this rate that we're going to eat bananas at rate of 6 .

Now let's check can we eat all the piles of bananas at rate of 6. Let's check it,
image

If you see that we just eat all piles of bananas in 6 hour is that a good value. Well it is less than or equals to 8 hours, but still we have to find the minimum possible of k value. This might be the solution but less try is there any more smaller k value then 6.
So, we decrement our right pointer to mid - 1 becuase there might be the best possible solution available.

So, once again we compute the middle by taking the average of left & right / 2 i.e. 1 + 5 / 2 = 3 our k is here at 3 value

Now let's check can we eat all the piles of bananas at rate of 3. Let's check it,
image

If you see that we just eat all piles of bananas in 10 hour but if you see we went over 8 hours we took too long to eat all the bananas. So, eating at rate of 3 didn't work.
Let's start searching to right of our range we increment our left pointer to mid + 1 but remember when we shift our right pointer from the last position to mid -1 we just consider that this range will not work. And that's how Binary search work!

So, once again we compute the middle by taking the average of left & right / 2 i.e. 4 + 5 / 2 = 4 our k is here at 4 value

Now let's check can we eat all the piles of bananas at rate of 4. Let's check it,
image

If you see that we just eat all piles of bananas in 8 hour. So, we able to eat all bananas in less than or equals to 8 hours if we had a rate of 4. Let's compare this with our current result. So, far we find a value of 6 we update this 6 and we can say there is a more smaller rate we can use i.e. 4.

But if we try to calculate more further on then we see our right pointer moves more left to the left pointer. Then we can now stop our Binar Search.
I hope you got the point. Let's code it up

code each line explained : Similar for C++ & Java

Step 1 :
int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = 1000000000;
        
        while(left <= right){ // performing binary search
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // doing in that way, to handle overflow instead of left + right / 2
            // if koko can eat, mid bananas per hour in less then or equals to h time
            if(canEatInTime(piles, mid, h)) right = mid - 1; // means decrement our right pointer to optimise better solution 
            else left = mid + 1; // if not true, increment left pointer
        }
        return left; // bcz left pointer hold our optimize k, at the end of BS
    }
Step 2 :
boolean canEatInTime(int piles[], int k, int h){
        
        int hours = 0; // track count of hours
        for(int pile : piles){
            // performing claculation, take an example 
            // k = 4
            // pile = 10

            // pile / k => 10 / 4 = 2
            // pile % k => 2, so we need to have one more hour to eat remaining bananas left over as remainder 
            // hours = 3;
            int div = pile / k;
            hours += div;
            if(pile % k != 0) hours++; // if remainder value is not 0, we need to have an extra hour
        }
        return hours <= h;
